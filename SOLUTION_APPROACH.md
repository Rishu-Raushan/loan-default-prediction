# Solution Approach - Loan Default Prediction

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive approach to solving the loan default prediction problem for financial institutions. The solution addresses all evaluation criteria including EDA, preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, business interpretation, imbalanced data handling, and production deployment.

## 1. Problem Understanding

### Business Context
Financial institutions face significant losses from loan defaults. Traditional risk assessment methods based solely on credit scores and income are insufficient for capturing complex patterns in borrower behavior. A machine learning solution can:

- Reduce financial losses by identifying high-risk borrowers
- Improve loan approval processes
- Optimize risk-based pricing
- Maintain regulatory compliance
- Enhance customer segmentation

### Technical Challenge
Build a binary classification model to predict loan default probability considering:
- Class imbalance (fewer defaults than non-defaults)
- Missing values across features
- Outliers in financial data
- High-dimensional feature space
- Need for model interpretability

### Success Metrics
- Primary: ROC-AUC score (handles class imbalance)
- Secondary: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, PR-AUC
- Business: Cost reduction from avoided defaults

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

### Data Overview
- Total samples: 255,347 loan applications
- Features: 38 variables (numerical and categorical)
- Target: Binary (Default / Non-Default)
- Class imbalance ratio: Approximately 10:1

### Key Findings

**1. Target Variable**
- Significant class imbalance requiring special handling
- SMOTE, class weights, and ensemble methods recommended

**2. Numerical Features**
- Income distribution: Right-skewed, requires transformation
- Credit amount: Wide range, some extreme values
- Age and employment days: Negative values (days before application)
- Score sources: Normalized scores from external bureaus

**3. Categorical Features**
- Education level: 5 categories
- Marital status: 4 categories
- Income type: 8 categories
- Occupation: 18 categories

**4. Missing Values**
- Several features have missing values (5-20%)
- Imputation strategy varies by feature type
- Some missingness may be informative

**5. Correlations**
- Strong correlation between income and credit amount
- Negative correlation between age and default rate
- Employment stability impacts default probability

## 3. Data Preprocessing Strategy

### Missing Value Treatment

**Numerical Features**
- Median imputation for continuous variables
- Mode imputation for discrete counts
- Drop features with >50% missing values

**Categorical Features**
- Mode imputation for low cardinality
- Create "Unknown" category for high cardinality
- Missing indicator for potentially informative missingness

### Outlier Handling
- IQR method with 1.5x threshold
- Capping extreme values rather than removal
- Domain knowledge for validation (e.g., income, credit amount)
- Preserve data points but limit influence

### Feature Scaling
- StandardScaler for tree-based models compatibility
- Robust to outliers after capping
- Applied to all numerical features

### Categorical Encoding
- Binary features: Label encoding
- Low cardinality (<10): One-hot encoding
- High cardinality: Target encoding (with regularization)
- Ordinal features: Ordinal encoding

## 4. Feature Engineering

**2. Class Weights**
- Logistic Regression: class_weight='balanced'
- Random Forest: class_weight='balanced'
- XGBoost: scale_pos_weight parameter
- Penalizes errors on minority class more heavily

**3. Evaluation Metrics**
- Avoid accuracy (misleading with imbalance)
- Focus on ROC-AUC (threshold-independent)
- PR-AUC (precision-recall trade-off)
- Confusion matrix analysis
- Business cost-based threshold optimization

**4. Ensemble Methods**
