# Loan Default Prediction - Complete Solution

## Project Overview

This project implements a production-ready machine learning solution to predict loan defaults for financial institutions. The solution addresses class imbalance, handles missing values, performs comprehensive feature engineering, and includes a complete deployment architecture.

## Problem Statement

Financial institutions need to predict loan defaults to manage risk and maintain profitability. This solution builds a classification model considering multiple factors including income, employment status, credit score, loan amount, and other relevant variables.
